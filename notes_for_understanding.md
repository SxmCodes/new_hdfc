3. pandas as pd - data manuplation and analysis with dataframes. 
4. numpy as np - numerical operations (since our data is in numeric values, like any other dataset). Also have arrays and mathamatical things to help us. 
5. sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split - Spliting data into training and testing set. 
6. sklearn.compose.ColoumnTransformer - pre-processing to diff columns. 
7. sklearn.impute.SimpleImputer - Fills missing values in data. 
8. sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder, StandardScalar - Explores numerical features. 
9. sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier - for classification. 
10. joblib - for saving python objects (like trained data models)

## File paths
##### these are files which has datasets, test with clean features and loan model pipelines and loan status. 
1. src - Path("filename")
2. clean_out
3. pipe_out
4. labeled_out
5. target_label
